# Overview

This repository contains the code for predicting the future stock prices of Google (GOOG) using RandomForestRegressor with rmse +- 2 unit

# Features

RandomForestRegressor model for stock price prediction
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model evaluation metrics
Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices

# Data

The dataset used in this project is the historical stock price data for Google (GOOG) from Yahoo Finance.
# Results

The model is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics. 
The results show that the model is able to accurately predict future stock prices.

# Visualization

The predicted vs. actual stock prices are visualized using a line chart. 
This allows you to see how the model's predictions compare to the actual stock prices.
